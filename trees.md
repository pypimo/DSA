# Binary Trees
## types
1. full bt - each node has 0/2 children
2. complete bt - each level is completely filled xcpt last level (which must have nodes as left as possible)
3. perfect bt - all leaf nodes are at same level
4. balanced bt - height = log n (no of nodes)
5. degenerate - like a linked list, each node has  only 1 child
