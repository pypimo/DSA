# Data Structures and Algorithms
- -> Resource for this repo **Striver's A2Z sheet** and **striver's yt videos** 
- -> `Beta Code` headings = my code versions before reading any of striver's code (i wrote them after understanding the theory and solved bugs to arrive at the solution on my own)
- -> 0-raw.md -> many folders contain these - they are draft versions of my notes or contain practice problems
